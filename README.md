# Owl's Dosimeter
Certain medicines do not ship with dosimeters or a way to tell how many doses are left. This program is designed to solve that problem by recording the amount of doses left and keeping a lot of date and time when you took said dose.

## Compiling
This program is dependant on wxWidgets 3.0+ being installed on your system. Run `make` to compile.
